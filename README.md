To display basketball player details

1. I have linked main.dart file to the Homescreen(),
2. From homescreen i have displayed a basic layout on scaffold using Pageview for player details and smoothpageIndicator for page scrolling.
3. Using a simple for loop i have loaded all the player detail from datamodel.dart file.
4. I have converted the data format to a list using .map() and passed it to pageview().
5. Pageview is desgined using card layout, Flexible and MediaQuery tools to handle page resizing.
6. Thank you.
